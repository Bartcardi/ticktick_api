# ticktick_api
Workaround to expose ticktick functionality via REST API.

## Introduction
[TickTick](https://ticktick.com) is a great ToDo and productivity platform with various client apps. Unfortunately, the
platform does not support connecting external services via an API. This repository demonstrates how to set up a DIY API to
TickTick via node and chrome headless browser. This repository is a work in progress and more detailed instructions will follow.
Feel free to open an issue with any questions.
